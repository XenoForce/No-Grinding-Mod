# No Grinding Mod
Grind a lot less in the game.

**WARNING:**

This is effectively a cheat mod. Don't use this mod, if you don't want the original game-play of the game spoiled for you!

**Notes:**

Worker drones build faster.

Once you have proven that you know HOW to mine or produce a certain resource (item), then you can purchase/unlock an item source for it (on the tech tree), in order to reduce the enormous resource-gathering GRIND over-head of the game. This way, you can focus more on all the fun parts of the game.
